# Wille

Requirements:
 * npm - https://docs.npmjs.com/

### Install
You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
```
From the root of the Wille theme run the following:

```sh
$ npm install
```
When npm is done installing all packages, then run gulp, which will compile all
sass to css.
```sh
$ gulp
```

 ### Coding
 Do all your theming in /wille/sass.
 Happy theming.
